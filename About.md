## Hello, I'm Matt Roberts

I'm a web developer based up North in Preston/Lancaster. This is my new techy blog, where I waffle on about all things coding that I found exciting, interesting, or generally share-worthy.

You'll find most things here .NET biased, although sometimes it may be front-end dev-esque, ruby, or node.js based.

You can find me on twitter as [@mattwoberts](https://twitter.com/#!/mattwoberts), and contact me on roberts dot mattroberts at gmail dot com.


Thanks for reading :-)
